# Aquarium Boss
Run an aquarium! Feed sharks! What could go wrong? Rust port of a C++ command line game I had coded previously.

##### Why did this interest me?
<blockquote>
The original C++ game has sentimental value to me--I coded it for an introductory course after failing the previous
assignment (hello seg fault during the demo!). It was the last term of a year where professors and teaching assistants
alike seemed intent on scaring me out of engineering with comments like, "this is NOT hard" and, "well, people are either
naturals at programming, or they aren't." I inferred their meanings loud and clear: if it was hard, I wasn't a natural and
had no place there. 
<br/>
<br/>
There was only one thing left to do: <b>make things weird</b>. This game was the first coding assignment I had ever finished early.
I had time to build in meerkat rebellions, animal-naming functions, monkey escapes in response to overcrowding, and
vaccination campaigns (the latter was a response to measles outbreaks in 2019, not the thing that happened a year later).
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't get extra credit and nobody actually played it, but I was happy. That wasn't a feeling I had ever associated
with programming before, and I hold onto that spirit when things get hard now. I keep several aquariums at home, so it
was a no-brainer to do an undersea theme for the reboot of the game.
</blockquote>

##### What did I hope to learn?
<blockquote>There isn't one easy way to port code from C++. Partial transpilers from C do exist, but ultimately, trying to port this game
has been more like copying a painting than following a recipe. I had only ever used Rust for a class project involving multi-threaded race
conditions... which was informative but dry. I wanted to see how Rust's memory-safe approach made me feel about a program with a lot
of moving parts and randomly-triggered events--the same scenarios that used to give me valgrind headaches searching for memory leaks.
</blockquote>

##### How could this be improved?
<blockquote>Still in progress and to be completed when I get a working version up :)</blockquote>
